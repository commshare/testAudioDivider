Version 1.0.3 - December 1, 2011
--------------------------------
Added abitlity to automatically update the registry to make the application startup upon logging in (startup).


Version 1.0.2 - October 27, 2011
--------------------------------
Added hotkey support. Now the user can setup a hotkey to do the switching. No more need to launch the application 
(even though the behaviour will still work), or to click the switch button.

Version 1.0.1 - October 12, 2011
--------------------------------
Fixed issue #1 with the application.
Issue was that when a device that was in the switch list was removed from the computer, it would still remain in the switch list, thus making the switching innefective.
The resolution was that upon application startup, remove all the non-existant devices from the switch list. The application still doesn't listen for
a device removal notification from Windows, but that'll be for issue #2 whenever i'll file it.


Version 1.0  - September 26, 2011 
---------------------------------

Initial 1.0 release of the application. It contains the basic functions to provide the device switching ability.
